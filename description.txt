Socrata data portals have a built-in analytics page. Here are the open analytics pages for some other portals.

https://data.austintexas.gov/analytics
https://data.hawaii.gov/analytics
https://explore.data.gov/analytics
https://bronx.lehman.cuny.edu/analytics
https://data.oregon.gov/analytics
https://data.ok.gov/analytics
https://data.seattle.gov/analytics
https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/analytics

Your analytics page is not currently published openly, and I suggest that it be published openly.

I personally would like to use the analytics page towards some research. I have recently been studying the ecosystem of open data by analyzing usage patterns across all of the Socrata open data portals; you can read about some of my work at http://thomaslevine.com/socrata . Open publishing of your analytics page would allow me to conduct longitudinal analyses to study the impacts of specific events (such as policy changes, hackathons/conferences, and press coverage) on the use of open data.

To have the page published openly, you just need tell Socrata's technical support to enable the page.
