However, Confidential Information does not include any information that:  (a) was known to the receiving party prior to receiving the same from the disclosing party in connection with this Agreement; (b) is independently developed by the receiving party; (c) is acquired by the receiving party from another source without restriction as to use or disclosure; or (d) is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or action of the receiving party.&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\&quot;Customer Content\\&quot; means user profiles, datasets, discussion forums, and other interactive areas, features or services in which Customer or its end users create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, datasets, data structures, spreadsheets, entries, information, text, music, sound, photos, video, graphics, code or other items or materials for display on the Site.&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\&quot;Effective Date\\&quot; is the date on which Customer accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement.&lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\&quot;Services\\&quot; means the Socrata services ordered by Customer through an authorized Socrata reseller and provisioned by Socrata in accordance with the terms and conditions herein.  &lt;/li&gt;\\n  &lt;li&gt;\\&quot;Site\\&quot; means the Socrata web site through which the Services will be made available to Customer.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Limited License&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Customer is hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, non-sublicensable, non transferable license to access and use the Site, the online Socrata software applications made available by Socrata, if any, for use by Customer with the Site (\\&quot;Site Applications\\&quot;) and the Services, including the right to load, store and display Customer Content on the Site.  The license is subject to the terms of this Agreement and does not include the right to: (a) operate or use the Site or the Site Applications on behalf of other entities or persons (e.g., operate as a service bureau) other than as may be approved by Socrata; (b) modify or otherwise make any derivative uses of the Site or the Site Applications, or any portion thereof; or (c) use of the Site, the Site Applications or the Services other than for their intended purposes.  Customer will use the Site, Site Applications and the Services in conformance with applicable laws.  Any use of the Site, the Site Applications or the Services other than as specifically authorized herein, without the prior written permission of Socrata, is strictly prohibited and may result in Socrata terminating the license.  Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as conferring any license to Customer of any other intellectual property rights of Socrata or its third party licensors or suppliers, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Customer Password&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Customer agrees to (a) maintain the security of Customer&#x27;s password or key provided by Socrata to access and load Customer Content on the Site; and (b) accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Customer Content or other information Customer provides to Socrata.

Fees&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Customer is entitled to certain data storage and data delivery levels each month, as measured in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2018bytes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019  If Customer exceeds the applicable Services monthly usage limits, Socrata will notify Customer of such overage.  Customer will either take steps to keep its usage under the applicable limits, or engage with Socrata to upgrade the Service to the appropriate usage level.  If Customer exceeds the monthly usage limits for 3 months during the term of this Agreement, Socrata may terminate the Services by written notice to Customer.  Unused data delivery bytes expire at the end of each calendar month during the term of this Agreement and at termination of this Agreement.  The Social Data Platform is delivered as a software as a service, whereby such Service will be terminated by Socrata upon termination or non-renewal of this Agreement.  Socrata reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate Customer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s access to the Services for Customer&#x27;s non-payment of fees.  If Customer requires Socrata to train Customer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s team members, Customer will reimburse Socrata for the reasonable travel related costs it incurs in connection with such training.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;5. Confidential Information&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each party reserves any and all right, title and interest that it may have in or to any Confidential Information that it may disclose to the other party under this Agreement.  The receiving party will protect Confidential Information of the disclosing party against any unauthorized use or disclosure to the same extent that the receiving party protects its own Confidential Information of a similar nature against unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event will use less than a reasonable standard of care to protect such Confidential Information; provided that the Confidential Information of the disclosing party is conspicuously marked or otherwise identified as confidential or proprietary upon receipt by the receiving party or the receiving party otherwise knows or has reason to know that the same is Confidential Information of the disclosing party.  The receiving party will use any Confidential Information of the disclosing party solely for the purposes for which it is provided by the disclosing party.  This paragraph will not be interpreted or construed to prohibit: (a) any use or disclosure which is necessary or appropriate in connection with the receiving party &#x27;s performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties; (b) any use or disclosure required by applicable law (e.g., pursuant to applicable securities laws or legal process), provided that the receiving party uses reasonable efforts to give the disclosing party reasonable advance notice thereof (e.g., so as to afford the disclosing party an opportunity to intervene and seek an order or other appropriate relief for the protection of its Confidential Information from any unauthorized use or disclosure); or (c) any use or disclosure made with the consent of the disclosing party.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;6. Customer Content&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Customer is solely responsible for all Customer Content and the use of the interactive areas of the Site.

Any use of the Site, the Site Applications or the Services in violation of the foregoing violates this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of Customer&#x27;s right to use the Site, the Site Applications and the Services.  In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect Socrata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s systems and customers, or to ensure the integrity and operation of Socrata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s business and systems, Socrata may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, user profile information (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic information, usage history, and posted Customer Content. Socrata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s right to disclose any such information will govern over any terms of Socrata\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\u2019s Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;7. Rights to Customer Content&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Except for Suggestions as described in Section 8 below, Customer retains the copyright in and all ownership of the Customer Content.
